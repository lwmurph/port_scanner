        "# Password Generator from Website Scraper\n",
        "This script generates passwords by scraping text from a website and hashing it. It includes a loading bar to show progress and allows saving the result to a file. The script ensures that passwords are consistent across multiple scrapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scrapes text from a specified URL.\n",
        "- Generates a deterministic password using SHA-3-512 hashing.\n",
        "- Displays a loading bar to indicate progress.\n",
        "- Compares passwords from multiple scrapes to ensure consistency.\n",
        "- Offers options to save the generated password or the website URL to a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- requests: For making HTTP requests to the website.\n",
        "- beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML and extracting text.\n",
        "- hashlib: For hashing text to generate passwords.\n",
        "- re: For regular expression operations.\n",
        "- sys: For displaying progress in the terminal.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensure you have the required libraries. You can install them using pip:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Run the Script:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "python password_generator.py\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input Prompts:** \\\n",
        " - Website URL: Enter the URL of the website you want to scrape. \\\n",
        " - Password Length: Enter the desired length of the password (between 4 and 50 characters). \\\n",
        "3. **Progress Indicator:**\n",
        " - The script will display a loading bar showing the progress of password generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Save Options:\n",
        " - After generating passwords, you can choose to save either the password or the URL to a file.\n",
        " - Enter a filename and a descriptive name for the password (e.g., Netflix, Instagram).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example\n",
        "```\n",
        "Enter the website URL: http://example.com\n",
        "Enter a password length (4-50 characters): 12\n",
        "[testing website][██████████████████████████████████████] 100.00% Complete\n",
        "[info] Passwords are consistent after multiple scrapes\n",
        "Would you like to save the password or the website URL to a file? (password/url/[N]o): password\n",
        "Enter the filename to save to: passwords.txt\n",
        "input name entry for password (e.g. netflix, instagram, ...): netflix\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, a password is generated from http://example.com, checked for consistency, and saved to passwords.txt with the label Netflix.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Error Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Invalid URL Format: The script checks if the URL is valid.\n",
        "- Website Unreachable: The script ensures the website is reachable and responds with HTTP status code 200.\n",
        "- Inconsistent Passwords: If passwords differ between scrapes, an error is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notes\n",
        "- Ensure that the website you are scraping is static and does not change frequently to get consistent results.\n",
        "- The script currently assumes that the content of the website is in <p> tags. Adjust the scraping logic if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**To ensure the repeatability of your password generation, you should choose websites or sources where the content remains static and unchanging. Here are some examples of such sources:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        ">**Public Domain Books:** Websites hosting public domain books, like Project Gutenberg, where the content of books remains unchanged.\\\n",
        "*Example: Project Gutenberg* \\\n",
        "> **Government Websites:** Certain government documents or archives that do not change frequently.\\\n",
        "*Example: USA.gov* \\\n",
        "> **Static Educational Resources:** Websites hosting educational resources or historical documents that are not updated frequently.\\\n",
        "*Example: Khan Academy*\\\n",
        ">**Archived Web Pages:** Websites like the Internet Archive that provide archived snapshots of web pages. \\\n",
        "*Example: Internet Archive*\\\n",
        "> **PDF Documents:** Direct links to PDF documents hosted on websites that are not updated frequently."
